HOW TO CHANGE VERTEX IDs

Bit of a problem. Each row has to be treated as a node in the Graph meaning it's properties has to be preserved. 

Possible solution is to store the unique IDs in a Hashmap and map them to integer IDs.
Then check column 0 and 1 against the Hashmap and change their values. Should take some timesince this cannot be done inplace.

1. Read the identifiers into a Hashmap and map them against integers.
2. Read the data into ArrayList
3. Loop through the Arraylist and check index 0 and 1 against the Hashmap
4. Profit

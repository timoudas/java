LOG FOR GENOME PROJECT

11/05

Cloned repo to statinary computer since dataset is 7gb... means not able to utilize my 60gb MacBook Air... Thank you Lars now I HAVE to sit on my desk

Downloaded dataset and created folder data/
Used unix to create a small test suite be doing:

head -10 > test.txt

HOW TO CHANGE VERTEX IDs

Bit of a problem. Each row has to be treated as a node in the Graph meaning it's properties has to be preserved. 

Possible solution is to store the unique IDs in a Hashmap and map them to integer IDs.
Then check column 0 and 1 against the Hashmap and change their values. Should take some timesince this cannot be done inplace.

1. Read the identifiers into a Hashmap and map them against integers.
2. Read the data into ArrayList
3. Loop through the Arraylist and check index 0 and 1 against the Hashmap
4. Profit

A bit tideous but I seem to have succesfully loaded my test file into a Graph structure. Only thing remaining is to check overlap on contigs to exclude edges.

The process is as following:

Constructor: Takes one argument: A filename that contains the nodes

The construtor calls on ParseData(String filename) that does the following:

1. Initiates the adj_list with number of _vertices that the Graph is expeted to have. 

2. LoadIdentifiers() loads the file and adds all unique Identifiers it can find in the file into an ArrayList and returns the list.

3.ParseIdentifiers() takes the ArrayList of Identifiers and instanciates a Hashmap where every Identifier is mapped against a unique initiger. The function returns the Hashmap with the mapped Identifiers.

4. BuildGraph() takes the Hashmap and the filename. It reads the filename and checks the Identifiers against the Hashmap, if it finds the Identifiers it changes them against their unique Integer and adds an Edge(u,v) where u,v are integers. When Edge() is called it first calls on checkElem() that checks if the node (u,v) exists already. If it exists it returns True else False. If it returns False and u != v then the node is added into the Adjecancy matrix. This is to avoid dublicates.

#TODO

Check the overlaps of the contigs and exlude those that have overlap.

#LATER VALIDATION

Nummer of vertices can later be validated against doing UNIX-operation

#UNKNOWN UNIX-Op

Diskussed with Edvin regarding the reading of the file of 7GB and concluded that file should not be read direclty in java and beated into shape while in memory.A better solution is to wrangle the data with the help of UNIX awk and concatenate the "true" file before reading it.


Below script checks if the overlapp of first contig is the same as the length of the first contig
awk '$7-$6==$8 {print $7-$6, $8}' test.txt

How I interpret the logic:

#FIRST STATEMENT
For example, if columns 6, 7, and 8 are indicating the whole contig is involved in the overlap, then this line can be ignored: it should not define an edge. 

This means that if awk '$7-$6==$8 {print $7-$6, $8}' test.txt holds true than that line should be disregarded

#SECOND STATEMENT
Columns 6-8 and 10-12 describes the overlap. It the overlap is actually containment — if contig A is a subsequence of contig B — then A should be discarded because it is redundant.

This is really fuzzy... But It means the same thing as the first statement

Lars comment: "No. If A has length 4711 and the coordinates indicate that the overlap starts at position 0 and ends at position 4711, then all of A is in the overlap, meaning that B contains A.
... and A can be disregarded"

Conclusion: if 7 - 6 = 8 then we remove A; If 11 - 10 = 12 then we remove B;

Logic to build:

for line in fie:
    If $7-$6==$8:
	remove row and $1
    elif $11-$10$==$12:
	remove row and $2

How:
   * Iterate file and cat a new file containg all redundand contigs
   * Iterate file and check if contigs are in file containg redundant contigs
     and remove all lines where condition holds True
   * Profit
   * Now we have a smaller file hopefully
